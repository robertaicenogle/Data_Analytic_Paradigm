## The command line
Software developers and programmers typically use the command line to navigate and perform tasks on their computers
- For macOS, you'll use the Terminal application to access the command line
- For Windows, you'll use the Command Prompt
- Git Bash is an application for Microsoft Windows environments that installs Bash and Git on a Windows operating system. 
- Bash is an acronym for "Bourne-again shell."  
- A shell is a terminal application, like Terminal on macOS,  used to interface with an operating system through written commands.

## Gitbash
When it comes to using GitHub on a Windows PC, we can't use the Command Prompt.
- To use Git on Window we will need to install the Git Bash, often called "Bash" for short
- Programmers depend on this tool for version control, which is the process of logging the development of programs and applications
- This comes in handy during collaborative programming, when teams of programmers change, add, and remove code throughout a project's directory
- This process would be chaotic without Git
